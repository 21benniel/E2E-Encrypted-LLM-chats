It is a subfield of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and techniques for training machines to make predictions and make decisions based on large amounts of data.\n\nIn simple terms, machine learning can be defined as the process of giving machines the ability to learn and improve on their own based on experience. It involves the development of algorithms that allow machines to recognize patterns in data, make predictions based on those patterns, and adjust their behavior based on new data.\n\nMachine learning is often used in areas such as predictive analytics, natural language processing, and robotics. It is being increasingly applied to a wide range of industries, from finance to healthcare to transportation.\n\nIn summary, machine learning is a powerful tool that enables computers to learn and improve on their own based on experience.",
